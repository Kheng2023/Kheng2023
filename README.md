# 🌱 Welcome to Yong Kheng's Digital Garden 🌿

Planting ideas, pruning complexity, and watering code with tests — currently tending a full‑stack startup garden (TypeScript, React, Node) and volunteering on a Drupal rebuild.

Here, I plant seeds of ideas, nurture projects with care, and look forward to harvesting meaningful impact through growth and learning.

### 👨‍💻 About the Gardener
<img src="octocat-1750481765474.png" alt="My Octocat" width="200"/>

I’m a **career changer** with a unique journey — from practicing as a **medical doctor** to growing a deep passion for **software development** and **AI**. I hold a Master of Computing and Innovation and I’m cultivating skills that blend medicine, data and software.

At UNESCO (IOC Ocean Decade) I turned a messy text survey into a searchable database so people worldwide can find past Ocean Decade projects to learn from and collaborate — that was a completed internship project I’m proud of.

Currently, I’m:

* 💻 Full‑stack intern — building front-end features and backend services at a startup using **TypeScript, React, and Node.js**; shipping features and improving developer experience.
* 🌐 Volunteering on a Drupal rebuild for [SAcommunity.org](https://sacommunity.org/) — focusing on maintainability, migrations, and clear handover documentation.
* 🌱 Continuing to learn about testing, CI/CD, and production observability to make projects more robust and easier to maintain.

When I’m not growing code, I’m literally in the garden—**volunteering at the Adelaide Botanic Garden** and enjoying gardening as a hobby. 🌿

My interests are deeply rooted in:

* 🌾 **Software Development**
* 🌻 **AI & Machine Learning**
* 🌸 **Data Analytics**
* 🌿 **Medical Technology & Innovation**
