# 🌱 Welcome to Yong Kheng's Digital Garden 🌿  
Here, I plant seeds of ideas, nurture projects with care, and look forward to harvesting meaningful impact through growth and learning.

### 👨‍💻 About the Gardener  
I’m a **career changer** with a unique journey—from practicing as a **medical doctor** to growing a deep passion for **software development** and **AI**. I hold a Master of Computing and Innovation from the **University of Adelaide (2024)**.

With roots in medicine, I’m now cultivating my skills in tech—growing toward a future where I can contribute to **life-changing medical software and technologies**.

Currently, I’m volunteering with a not-for-profit organization, helping redevelop their website—a rewarding project where I tend to both front-end and back-end challenges.

When I’m not growing code, I’m literally in the garden—**volunteering at the Adelaide Botanic Garden** and enjoying gardening as a hobby. 🌿
